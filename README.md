A Dental graduate who's passionate about technology .
 I'm in a mission to transform healthcare through innovative solutions
My roots in community service began with medical convoys across Sudan,
 where I witnessed firsthand the challenges of delivering healthcare in
 resource-limited settings.
  These experiences ignited my curiosity about how technology could bridge
   critical gaps in medical access.
    I'm developing skills to create technological solutions that can revolutionize
     how we approach community health.
      My toolkit combines dental expertise, data analysis, and emerging technologies
       like Al and tele-medicine.
Currently exploring:

* Healthcare technology
* Al in medical diagnostics
* Data-driven community health solutions
* Open-source projects bridging tech and wellness
